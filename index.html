  <center><h1> BAND BIO </h1></center>
<p style="color:red;">The WesBytes are a three piece experimental harsh noise band with a focus on animal biometrics. Their debut album, <i>NOIZE 4 SALE,</i> was recorded at the bottom of the Charles River using state-of-the art underwater recording technology. The music is inspired by the culture of the 1950's, except it's cyber-punk, steam-punk, and Gotham. The trio's main inspiration is pioneering 1950's noise rock artist, Elvis Presley.

Adam is currently working on new material for his debut solo album, <i>Alone With my Noize</i>. The project will be available for streaming exclusively on LimeWire starting July 6th.
