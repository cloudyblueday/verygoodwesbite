  <center><h1>  ABOUT THE BAND </h1></center>
<p style="color:red;">The WesBytes are a three piece experimental harsh noise band with a focus on animal biometrics. Their debut album, <i>NOIZE 4 SALE,</i> was recorded at the bottom of the Charles River using state-of-the art underwater recording technology. The music is inspired by the culture of the 1950's, except it's cyber-punk, steam-punk, and Gotham. The trio's main inspiration is pioneering 1950's noise rock artist, Elvis Presley. The WesBytes have swept all Noise Rock-related awards at the Grammys, Academy Awards, and Tony Awards for the past 15 years.

<p style="color:red;"> <center><b>DYLAN'S BIO</b></center>
  From a bunker in the Deceased Americas post 2150's Nuclear War, Dylan time traveled to 2022 to join The WesBytes and totally fuck up the time stream by joining her favorite band from the past. In her Deceased Americas bunker she had all their VHS tapes and now helps The WesBytes realize their future music by literally being from the future. She plays the wazoo. Not to be confused with the kazoo.
